There once was an old man who had an avid obsession with pretzels. He loved them. All shapes, sizes, saltiness,
sweetness, anything and everything about pretzels he absolutely adored. Because he had been retired for quite some time, 
he had made it his life goal to find the absolute best pretzel to go with the absolute best dip. 
His search had lead him far across the land, from the Mongolian Steppe, to the brutal heat of the Australian desert. At long last,
he found the perfect kind of pretzel- the ever so glorious Rold Gold Guaranteed Fresh TM Braided Honey Wheat pretzel (patent pending). 
Now the only further question was what dip to pair with this delicious treat and how to use such invaluable knowledge!

His dip options were mustard, salt, cinnamon sugar, caramel, chocolate, and cheese.

He made a rating system to test his dip options and sent the test all over the world to see what other people thought about the dips.
Ultimately, he found that many people had different opinions about dips and no one dip stood out. So, he decided to offer them all.
